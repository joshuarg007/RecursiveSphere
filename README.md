# WebGL Sphere Generator

This project is a WebGL application that dynamically generates and renders a sphere by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron. It employs shaders to apply color and lighting effects to the sphere's surface.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need a modern web browser that supports WebGL. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the rendered sphere.

## Usage

Once the sphere is rendered, you can interact with it by rotating it around the y-axis. The sphere is generated with an initial subdivision depth, which you can adjust in the `script.js` file to modify the level of detail.
